This script has three classes:

Config.php -> use to config the database:
# 
library.php-> has  the instance of the libraryClass.php and the config. This class doesnt requires any changes.
#
libraryClass.php-> has the definition of all common functions
#
I  have included a database that was used to test and yield the results for test.php
#
In order to set up a testing, change the username and password and host in the config.php and upload the database included here to your
server. 
#
More functions are to be added. This is just the beginning
